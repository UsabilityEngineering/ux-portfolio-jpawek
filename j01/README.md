# The Questionable UX of Tesla

After landing his job at Google my brother's first big purchase was a Tesla Model 3 Performance. It has all of the gas saving benefits of an electric vehicle, capable safety equipment, a blistering 0-60 speed, and, importantly for this journal entry, heaps and heaps of intricate features in a minimalist design.

If you are unfamiliar with Tesla's interior design style, the front dash of the Model 3 looks like this:

Notice that there is a complete lack of analog buttons on the dashboard. In fact, it is so minimalist that even the A/C vents are tucked away and hidden, making them impossible to adjust physically. As such, any **conventions** that a user is accustomed to out of other vehicles do not apply.  

The control features that would typically be found in the cabin are instead integrated in the central touchscreen which acts as a display for the speedometer, navigation, radio and music controls, climate control settings, current drive mode, autopilot status, and quite a bit more. There are so many features that there are a total of 14 pages in the Model 3 owner's manual that focus purely on controlling the touchscreen.

Specifically I'd like to focus on my experience with managing the climate control settings. The homepage of the central screen provides a simple temperature display. This can be changed by single degrees or if you tap and hold the number you can use a slider for greater temperature changes. You can see it along with buttons to toggle defrosters and seat heaters at the bottom of this image:

This works fine when you want to leave the climate control system on auto and let the car control the ambient temperature. It's an easily **learnable** and **effective** control, it does its job well with a straight forward control scheme that can quickly be understood.

However, once you want to take the climate control out of auto and make specific manual adjustments it gets quite a bit more complicated. For example, one time after going on a long hike I wanted to max out the A/C and point the vents towards myself. In order to adjust the climate control system manually you first have to tap the fan icon on the homepage, something that isn't particularly immediately obvious. Then you are met with the climate control screen with all of its settings. Here is a diagram identical to the Model 3's climate control screen out of the Model X owner's manual:

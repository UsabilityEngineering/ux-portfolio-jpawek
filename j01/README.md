# The Questionable UX of Tesla

After landing his job at Google my brother's first big purchase was a Tesla Model 3 Performance. It has all of the gas saving benefits of an electric vehicle, capable safety equipment, a blistering 0-60 speed, and, importantly for this journal entry, heaps and heaps of intricate features in a minimalist design.

If you are unfamiliar with Tesla's interior design style, the front dash of the Model 3 looks like this:

Notice that there is a complete lack of analog buttons on the dashboard. In fact, it is so minimalist that even the A/C vents are tucked away and hidden, making them impossible to adjust physically.

The control features that would typically be found in the cabin are instead integrated in the central touchscreen which acts as a display for the speedometer, navigation, radio and music controls, A/C settings, current drive mode, autopilot status, and quite a bit more. There are so many features that there are a total of 14 pages in the Model 3's owner manual that focus purely on controlling the touchscreen.

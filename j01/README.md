# The Questionable UX of Tesla

After landing his job at Google my brother's first big purchase was a Tesla Model 3 Performance. It has all of the gas saving benefits of an electric vehicle, capable safety equipment, a blistering 0-60 speed, and, importantly for this journal entry, heaps and heaps of intricate features in a minimalist design.

If you are unfamiliar with Tesla's interior design style, the front dash of the Model 3 looks like this:

Notice that there is a complete lack of physical buttons on the dashboard. In fact, it is so minimalist that even the A/C vents are tucked away and hidden, unable to be adjusted physically.
